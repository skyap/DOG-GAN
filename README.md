# Rules of competition:
### This is a Kernels-only competition
Submissions to this competition must be made through Kernels.   
In order for the "Submit to Competition" button on the kernel's "Output" tab to be available after a commit, the following conditions must be met:  

CPU Kernel <= 9 hours run-time with 16 GB RAM globally available  
GPU Kernel <= 9 hours run-time with 13 GB RAM globally available (Turn on via kernel "Settings" menu)  
No TPU support in Kernels, currently  
No internet access enabled  
No external data can be added as a data source  
No use of other kernels (or utility scripts) as inputs into your submission kernel  
No custom packages enabled in kernels
